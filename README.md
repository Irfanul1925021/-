Tomatoes is one of the most widely cultivated and con-
sumed vegetables worldwide, playing a significant role in
human nutrition [1]. Leaf diseases by various fungi, vi-
ruses, and bacteria degrade crop production enormously
[2]. Moreover, the thriving tomato industry faces challenges
due to various leaf diseases that significantly affect crop yield
and quality. During the past twenty years, there have been sig-
nificant improvements in agriculture, specifically in the field of
precision agriculture that involves the use of technology in ag-
riculture enormously.
Deep learning techniques have revolutionized many fields in
recent years, including agriculture [3]. Early detection and di-
agnosis of plant diseases is one area where these technologies
have shown tremendous potential. By extracting complex pat-
terns and characteristics from sample photos, deep learning has
proven a powerful tool for effectively identifying different
types of tomato leaf disease. Despite the numerous works car-
ried out on this subject, there is a little investigation done using
the combination of DenseNet and Mobilenet method over the
traditional CNN approach. We employed the ensemble tech-
nique to take the benefits of both architectures.
In this study, we used the largest collection of tomato leaf dis-
ease dataset from the Kaggle [4], labeled as To- mato_mo-
saic_virus, Target_Spot, Bacterial_spot, Tomato_Yel-
low_Leaf_Curl_Virus, Late_blight, Leaf_Mold, Early_blight,
Spider_mites, Two-spotted_spider_mite, Tomato_healthy, and
Sep- toria_leaf_spot. This research investigates the implemen-
tation details, experimental findings, and comparative anal-
yses, as well as the efficacy of the suggested ensemble approach
in testing tomato leaf disease.
